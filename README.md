<b><h1># sqlchallenge</b></h1>
This is a project where I demonstrated my skills in data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis

I was tasked to do a research project about people whom Pewlett Hackard employed during the 1980s and 1990s. 

The data provided consisted of 6 csv files only.

Using <b>Postgresql</b> and <b>PGadmin 4</b>, I created tables from the csv information, so I could analyze the information contained in them.

<b>There were over 300,000 rows of data to analyze, sort and join together.</b>

Using these newly created tables, I was able to make inferences about these employees using the salaries of the employees, hire dates, managers and department information.

I have attached my SQL used to create the tables, my SQL queries and a data map of the tables that I created for reference. I also attached a link to my ERD below:
